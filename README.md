This repository contains the [Android](http://www.android.com/) application for
making the schedule of [Linuxdays Graz](http://linuxtage.at/) available offline.

It's based on https://github.com/mrud/pentabarf-android which itself is based on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fosdem-android/

This app uses the schedule generated by [Pentabarf](http://pentabarf.org/), the
open source conference planning software.
